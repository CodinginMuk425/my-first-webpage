        <p>This is my <strong>first guided webpage</strong>! I have done some smaller projects on my own, but this is one I'm really excited to start.</p>
    <p>In this course through <em>Epicodus</em>, I will be learing some of the following</p>
<ul>
    <li>Markdown</li>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>Javascript</li>
    <li>And many more!</li>
</ul>
<p>One of my most anticipated portions of the course will be covering Javascript.<br>
    I know it's a pretty complex language to learn, but I hope I can get a good enough understanding that I can apply it in my career moving forward.<br>
    I think I should learn quite a bit through Epicodus, <a href="http://www.epicodus.com/">check them out</a>!</p>
