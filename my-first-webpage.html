    <h2 class="topic">Why I'm Excited</h2>
<p>One of my most anticipated portions of the course will be covering Javascript.<br>
    I know it's a pretty complex language to learn, but I hope I can get a good enough understanding that I can apply it in my career moving forward.<br>
    I think I should learn quite a bit through Epicodus, <a href="http://www.epicodus.com/">check them out</a>!</p>
    <h2 class="topic">Facts About Me</h2>
    <p>A brief background about myself. I am <em>newish</em> to coding with a <em>minimal</em> amount of experience. I have always had an interest in the subject, but I ended up pursuing another path. I would <strong>love</strong> to learn more in the course and have a feeling it will be tough to understand at time. When I am not coding, I'm either working in marketing or I have free time with family and friends. During the winter months, my <strong>favorite</strong> thing to do on weekends is watch football! Such a fun sport to watch.</p>
