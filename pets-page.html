        <h1>My Fur Family</h1>
        <h2>The Cats</h2>
        <p>Growing up, I have had many animals in my life. We've had a bird, snake, lizads, and even the amazing fish. None of which have ever made an impact on my life like my cats.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Miley</li>
            <li>Ginger</li>
            <li>Gabby</li>
            <li>Gracie</li>
            <li>T-bone</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Why I love them</h2>
        <p>Each cat brough me pure joy. All cats had very unique personalities and left a special place in my heart.<br> 
            Though I want a dog one day, there will always be a place in the family for a cat.<br>
            Miley is our youngest cat. Although she's about 11 years old now, she still acts like a kitten.<br>
            Ginger is our diva cat. She had a rough time as a kitten but slowly became a queen.<br>
            Gabby was the hunter. She was always on the prowel and had killed many presents for the family.<br>
            Gracie was the one the got away. She was one of the sweetest cats we had. She got out one day and we never found her which broke everyone's heart.<br>
            T-bone was the boss of the neighborhood. He was always getting into fights with cats in the neighborhood, but he was the biggest lover of his family.</p>
