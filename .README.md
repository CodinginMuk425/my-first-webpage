#### _HTML Exercise for Epicodus, January 14th, 2020_

#### By _**Ramy Carter**_

## Description

_This is a project we have been instructed to create as a way to better our coding. It is the first project we will be using as a way to document our progression throughout the program and ensure we are applying the knowledge we obtain. The code is fairly simple thus far and includes HTML and will include some CSS. More to come._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _First you will need to create a Github account and link it to you local device_
* _Once linked and VS Code is uploaded to your device, you can start coding_
* _When using HTML, you need to save the file as a .html document_
* _This can be done through the terminal by creating a project directory (mkdir file-name)_
* _Next you'll use the 'touch' command to create a new file_
* _Once created, you can get coding!_

_{This should be done in VS code or any other coding tool that can link to Github.}_

## Known Bugs

_{This is currently a work in progress. The site will appear very plain and unfinished with absolutley no style. CSS will be implemented and other features along the way. Not sure if all files will be tied together at some point.}_

## Support and contact details

_{If there are any issues you notice with the pages/code, please reach out to me. I am happy to fix any mistakes as I am still very new to coding.}_

## Technologies Used

_{At this point, only HTML has been used with the basic and inline tags. More to come.}_
